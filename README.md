# My Minimal Rust OS
This project is my run through of the [Writing an OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com/)
created and maintained by Philipp Opperman.
I am hosting some documentation on what I did for each part on my website here: https://blog.hobcloud.net/blog/learning/minimal-rust-operating-system/
## Intention
I am running through the project so that I can learn more about Systems Programming
especially with Rust.
## Layout
For each part in the guide I am following I will create a separate Git branch to separate what I had done on each part.
